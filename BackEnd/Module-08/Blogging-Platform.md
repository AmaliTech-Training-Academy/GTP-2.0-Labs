# Advanced Optimization

### Project Overview

This phase of the Blogging Platform focuses on enhancing system performance, responsiveness, and scalability through asynchronous programming, concurrency control, and performance profiling. Learners will optimize the secured Spring Boot backend by applying asynchronous request handling, concurrency management, and DSA-driven optimization to ensure efficient API performance under high load.

Students will also perform profiling, monitoring, and metrics analysis to identify bottlenecks and validate performance improvements through measurable data collected using Postman or any frontend client.

### Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

- Apply asynchronous programming patterns (`CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService`, `@Async`) to improve API responsiveness
- Analyze and optimize backend performance bottlenecks using profiling tools and metrics-based reporting
- Implement concurrency and parallelism techniques to handle high-load blog operations (post publishing, comment moderation, analytics)
- Apply DSA concepts such as caching, hashing, sorting, and thread-safe collections for efficient data processing
- Measure and document before-and-after performance results using CPU, memory, and response time metrics
